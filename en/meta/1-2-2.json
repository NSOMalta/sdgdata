The unit of analysis could be either the individual or the household. The individuals or households are considered as multidimensionally poor if they are deprived in multiple dimensions, exceeding certain thresholds. </p>\n<p>EU Member States, Island, Norway, Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Turkey have a different approach to measure the multidimensional poverty using the concept of &quot;people at risk of poverty or social exclusion&quot; (AROPE) calculated by EUROSTAT using the data from EU statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC). AROPE consists of three components, and individuals are considered as &quot;at risk of poverty or social exclusion&quot; if they are &quot;at risk of poverty&quot; or &quot;severely materially and socially deprived&quot; or &quot;living in a household with a very low work intensity&quot;. <sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[1]</a></sup></p>\n<p>There is a multidimensional poverty measure specifically designed for children. A child is considered multidimensionally poor if s/he is simultaneously deprived in multiple dimensions. It identifies the dimensions of poverty and the indicators under each dimension, and has a similar structure to the AF methodology. However, it is different in that it focuses on the life-cycle of children, creating different sets of dimensions and indicators for different age groups (e.g., for ages 0-4, 5-11, 12-14, 15-17 years), and conducts analyses separately for each age group. In the global SDG database, the multidimensional poverty headcount (%) for the overall 0-17 age group has been used for countries reporting individual measures of child multidimensional poverty.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">1</sup><p> For more information please see Eurostat&#x2019;s definitions <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=EU_statistics_on_income_and_living_conditions_(EU-SILC)_methodology_-_people_at_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion\">https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=EU_statistics_on_income_and_living_conditions_(EU-SILC)_methodology_-_people_at_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion</a>. <a href=\"#footnote-ref-2\">&#x2191;</a></p></div></div>","UNIT_MEASURE__GLOBAL":"<p>Percent (%)</p>","CLASS_SYSTEM__GLOBAL":"<p>Not applicable</p>","SOURCE_TYPE__GLOBAL":"<p>Data sources used for calculating indicators differ from survey to survey in each country.

href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/49th-session/documents/BG-Item-3a-IAEG-SDGs-DataFlowsGuidelines-E.pdf\">Guidelines on Data Flows and Global Data Reporting for the SDGs</a>, which aim to establish efficient and transparent mechanisms for reporting on SDG data from national to international levels. The guidelines define a framework for national and international agencies to work together to improve the transmission and validation of SDG data at the global level. </p>\n<p>The Statistical Commission sets these guidelines under the overarching Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics and the Principles Governing International Statistical Activities, emphasizing in particular the principles of transparency, collaboration and communication, and professional and ethical standards. </p>\n<p>The guidelines mandate that SDG indicators be based on data produced and owned by national statistical systems, and that national statistical offices (NSOs) play a central coordinating role in the reporting process. The guidelines outline the roles and responsibilities of entities involved in the compilation of SDG data for global reporting, including NSOs, other national institutions, and international organizations. </p>\n<p>At the national level, the NSO, as coordinator of the National Statistical System, is expected to identify a national data provider for each indicator and liaise between national entities and international custodian agencies. For SDG Indicator 1.2.2, the data provider would be the national entity that is leading the development and monitoring of a measure of national multidimensional poverty recognized as official by the government. </p>\n<p>At the global level, custodian agencies are mandated to compile national SDG indicator data, to harmonize it to ensure quality, international comparability and the computation of regional aggregates, and to report (upload) the data to the Global SDG Indicator Database. In many instances, custodian agencies also support the methodological development of indicators and provide technical assistance to under-resourced national statistical systems. Custodian agencies are expected to publish a timeline of data collection activities, to ensure transparency and sufficient time for NSOs and national data providers to respond to requests for SDG data. </p>\n<p>SDG 1.2.2 is different from other SDG indicators in two important ways. Firstly, it is nationally defined and not a uniform measure across countries, and therefore it is not internationally comparable. Secondly, its custodians are NSOs and not international agencies. Because of these characteristics, UNDP, UNICEF and the World Bank collaborate as special partner agencies to provide a platform for compiling national SDG 1.2.2 data and reporting it to the global SDG database, a function typically performed by custodian agencies. While the special partner agencies strive to ensure that reported data is official and of good quality, they do not perform any harmonization or other processing of the data. The Guidelines on Data Flows and Global Data Reporting for the SDGs also require that national metadata be submitted at the same time as SDG data, to ensure accuracy and international comparability. The variety of methodologies for SDG Indicator 1.2.2 increases the relevance of national metadata as an instrument to ensure high quality and the accuracy of reported data. The three agencies also have extensive portfolios of technical assistance and capacity support to countries for the development of their national measures of multidimensional poverty. </p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>Poverty has traditionally been defined as the lack of money. However, the poor themselves consider their experience of poverty much more broadly. A person who is poor can suffer multiple disadvantages at the same time &#x2013; for example, they may have poor health or malnutrition, a lack of clean water or electricity, poor quality of work or little schooling. Focusing on one factor alone, such as income, is not enough to capture the true reality of poverty. Therefore, multidimensional poverty measures described above have been developed to create a more comprehensive picture by looking at multiple dimensions such as health, education, living standards. Official multidimensional poverty headcount (% population), official multidimensional poverty headcount (% of total households) and multidimensional deprivation for children (% of population under 18) are all about the headcount ratio trying to capture how many people, households, or children in the entire pool are regarded as multidimensionally poor. On the other hand, average share of weighted deprivation tries to capture the depth of multidimensional poverty. For instance, if there are 18 indicators to capture different dimensions of poverty, the person who is deprived in 5 indicators, and the person who is deprived in 15 indicators are considered to be both multidimensionally poor. However, the &apos;intensity&apos; of the poverty is different between these two people, which is captured by the average share of weighted deprivation.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The compiled data of SDG 1.2.2 is not intended to be comparable across countries due to national definitions. For instance, key parameters to calculate the measure such as the number of indicators, the weight allocated to each indicator etc, are tailored to the country specific context. </p>","target_number":"1.2","goal_number":"1","indicator_sort_order":"01-02-02"}
