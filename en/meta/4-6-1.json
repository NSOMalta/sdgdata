If disaggregated literacy rates help identify disparities within a population that hinder personal and social development allowing targeted interventions that promote social mobility and economic growth.</p>\n<p><em>Numeracy, as a domain of literacy, refers to the ability to understand, use, and communicate mathematical concepts in everyday life. It includes basic arithmetic, interpreting data, and solving simple numerical problems. Unlike reading and writing, information on numeracy is not systematically collected in national population censuses and may therefore be underrepresented in the monitoring of this indicator. To better capture basic numeracy skills, further development of demographic censuses and sample survey instruments is needed, including the formulation of context-relevant and meaningful questions.</em></p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>For most countries literacy is self-reported but there may be some challenges associated to changes over time in a given country and to differences in definition across countries. </p>\n<p>Literacy should be differentiated from functional literacy.
