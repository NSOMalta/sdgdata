Estimating the levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals is an important element of the efforts to achieve this objective.</p>\n<p>A comprehensive measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) system was developed for the periodic submission of countries&#x2019; relevant climate information and data. Under the Convention and its Kyoto Protocol, Parties are required to regularly provide climate information and data through the submission of specific transparency reports. </p>\n<p>The Paris Agreement adopted in 2015 marks the latest step in the evolution of the UN climate change regime and builds on the work undertaken under the Convention. Its central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Agreement also aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change.</p>\n<p>With the adoption of the Paris Agreement, the MRV system is being replaced by the new Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF), which has become operational with the submission of the first biennial transparency reports (BTRs) by the end of 2024. The BTRs are submitted every two years and include information on GHG emissions, policies and measures, progress towards targets, climate change impacts and adaptation, levels of support and capacity-building needs.
