DATA_COMP: |
 Notes:
 1. The method of computation of this proxy indicator is partially in line with the UN methodology, but it excludes the population component.
 2. Data from the Strategic Plan for Environment and Development (SPED) 2015 was used to delimit urban areas.
 3. Local Plans published between 1995 and 2006, and the Basemap 2018 were used to extract public open spaces. Orthophotos 2024 were used for the verification of open space character.
 4. Data from the Basemap 2018 was used to obtain a realistic value of the area allocated to streets.
 5. The estimation of the population share with access to open public spaces within 400 meters walking distance could not be assessed; this proxy indicator hence shows the share of the urban area that is open space for public use for all.
