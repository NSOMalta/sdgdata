<p>The percentage of sites exceeding the nitrates threshold indicator is calculated by considering data obtained via operational and 
surveillance monitoring of Maltaâ€™s groundwater bodies. Operational monitoring is carried out twice a year, whereby which the samples 
collected are tested for nitrates amongst other parameters. The values are than aggregated to obtain one value per year. 
The indicator then considers the total amount of sites sampled in that year, and the total amount of sites 
that had a detection over the threshold value of 50 mg/L. Hence, the final percentage indicates the total number of 
sites that had a detection of nitrates above 50mg/L as a percentage of the total amount of sites sampled in that year.</p>
