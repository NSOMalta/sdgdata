DATA_COMP: |
  The percentage of groundwater bodies exceeding the nitrate threshold indicator is calculated using data obtained from both operational and surveillance monitoring of Malta’s groundwater bodies. Operational monitoring is conducted biannually, during which collected samples are analysed for nitrates, among other parameters. The results are then aggregated to derive a single value per year.
  
  For groundwater bodies where more than one monitoring station is sampled, results are further aggregated to obtain one annual value per groundwater body. The indicator is subsequently calculated by considering the total number of groundwater bodies monitored in a given year and identifying those for which the annual average nitrate concentration exceeds the quality value of 50 mg/L.

  The resulting percentage therefore represents the proportion of groundwater bodies with nitrate concentrations above 50 mg/L relative to the total number of groundwater bodies monitored in that year.

  This method is different to the method considered for the River Basin Management Plan (RBMP) reporting. The source of data for both methods is the same; however, the RBMP reporting considers a six-year average time period, whilst the method for the SDG 6.2.3 indicator considers the yearly averages. Hence, the results of the two are not interchangeable.
