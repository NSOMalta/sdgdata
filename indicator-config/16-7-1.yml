  Notes:
  1. The above data shows ratios, which are more internationally comparable than simple proportions. Ratios show whether the respective cohort of people is over or under represented when considering its national population distribution.
  2. A value of 1 shows perfect representation, values above 1 depict over-representation, and values below 1 show under-representation.
  3. Missing figures for specific disaggregations denote zero values.
