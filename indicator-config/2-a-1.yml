  - series: 1. Agriculture orientation index for government expenditures
    value: |
      Notes:
      1. An AOI greater than 1 reflects a higher orientation towards the agriculture sector, which receives a higher share of government spending relative to its contribution to economic value added. An AOI smaller than 1 reflects a lower orientation to agriculture, while an AOI equal to 1 reflects neutrality in a government’s orientation to the agriculture sector.
      
      2. The reason for the spike in AOI in 2023 is the sharp drop in the Gross Value Added of Section A due to negative value added recorded in the aquaculture industry that year. For more information on this, refer to NSO's Aquaculture 2024 News Release, available at https://nso.gov.mt/fisheries/aquaculture-2024/
