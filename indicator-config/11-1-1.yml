  - series: 1. Proportion of urban population living in inadequate housing
    value: |
      Notes:
      1. This refers to the percentage of urban population living in households where the net monthly expenditure on housing or total housing costs (net of housing allowances) exceeds 30% of the total monthly income of the household or total disposable household income (net of housing allowances). The figures represent the share of households.
      2. A break in time series exists for the year 2023 – such data should not be compared to that for previous years.
      3. Following the 2021 Population and Housing Census, NSO introduced a new sampling frame of households and individuals which was used for the first time in EU-SILC as from 2023.
      4. EU-SILC was benchmarked with updated demographic estimates derived from the Census, however, due to the very low impact of statistical significance on the core EU-SILC indicators, no revisions on past time series data were necessary.

  - series: 7. Population living in households with moisture damages
