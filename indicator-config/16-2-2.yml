  Notes:
  1. Persons may have experienced multiple types of exploitation, therefore total for types of exploitation may not add up to the total number of victims.
  2. Forced labour includes domestic servitude.
  3. Victims include (i) persons registered (identified) by the Malta Police Force during the reference year, i.e. where victims have been formally identified as victims of human trafficking; and (ii) persons newly registered (presumed) with the Foundation for Social Welfare Services as victims of human trafficking during the reference year.
  4. Missing figures for specific disaggregations denote zero values.
