  **Notes:**
  + All alleged abuse types that apply are selected at referral. Therefore, the total number of referrals is not computed using the totals of the different types of abuse.			
  + A case is recorded every time a service user contacts the Child Protection Service. 			
  + Persons and types of abuse may be counted more than once since service users may be referred to the service more than once during the same reporting year. Since a case may remain active across the reporting years (carried over from one year to another).			
  + Rate of referrals is based on the mid-year population of children aged 0-14
