  Notes:
  1. This indicator measures the extent to which aggregate budget expenditure outturns reflect the amount originally approved, as defined in government budget documentation and fiscal reports.
  2. Scores are assigned on a four-point ordinal scale: Score A is given when the aggregate expenditure outturn was between 95% and 105% of the approved aggregate budgeted expenditure in at least two of the last three years; B is assigned when the values were between 90% and 110% in at least two of the last three years; C is given for values between 85% and 115% in at least two of the last three years; and D is assigned when the performance is less than required for a C score.
