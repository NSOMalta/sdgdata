  Note: The Red List Index shows the aggregate extinction risk for species within the country or region relative to its potential contribution to global species extinction risk. It is measured on a scale of 0 to 1, where 1 is the maximum contribution that the country or region can make to global species survival, equating to all species being classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, and 0 is the minimum contribution that the country or region can make to global species survival, equating to all species in the country or region having gone extinct.
